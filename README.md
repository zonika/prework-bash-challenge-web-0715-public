# Prework Bash Challenge

We're going to review what we just learned in the previous lesson on bash.

## Directions

1. Fork this repository, clone that fork, and open up the directory in terminal.

2. Open up the file in the `spec` directory called `bash_challenge_spec.rb`. This is our RSpec file where the tests for this challenge live.

3. Fill in the blanks (wherever you see '__') with the your answers.

4. You can check you answers by running `rspec` from the directory of the project you're in.

4. When you're finished (all of the tests pass and you're seeing green in your terminal):
* Stage the changes you made: `git add .`
* Commit those changes with a message: `git commit -m "all done"`
* Push those changed up to your fork: `git push origin master`
* Then open up a pull request on the original repository (that you cloned from).

Refer back to the previous sections, especially the first lab, if you need to.
